This code is for the MEAM510 robockey project using an ATmega32u4 processor

In your main c file, you only need to include the "common_robockey.h" header file


You must define and set the following characters:
	ADDRESS
	CHANNEL
	PACKET_SIZE
	
In your main method, before doing anything else, call the init_all() fuction

You will be given access to the following functions and variables:

	**
	void init_all()
	
	Initializes everything.  Your project must have the m_bus and m_rf in it (I'm going to add the m_wii
	for position sensing soon
	
	
	**
	void set_left(int)
	void set_right(int)
	
	These functions will set the left and right wheels, assuming you have the following pins assigned
	to the following actions and are using the motor driver I made:
	
	Lenable: B5
	Ldirection: C6 (high -> forward, low -> backward)
	Renable: B6
	Rdirection: C7 (high -> forward, low -> backward)
	
	
	**
	wait(int)
	
	Pauses execution for int seconds (does not affect the movement of the motors. Usefull for debugging)
	
	
	
	**
	bool wireless_buffer_full()
	
	True if the wireless buffer has changed.  Calling get_wireless_buffer(void) will set the value
	returned by this function to false
	
	
	**
	
	char* get_wireless_buffer(void)
	
	Returns a pointer to a character (or the first element of a character array) of length PACKET_SIZE
